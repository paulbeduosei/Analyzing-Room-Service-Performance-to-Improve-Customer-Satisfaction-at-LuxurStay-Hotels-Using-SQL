# Analyzing-Room-Service-Performance-to-Improve-Customer-Satisfaction-at-LuxurStay-Hotels
In this project, I worked with the Head of Operations at LuxurStay Hotels to analyze service performance across international hotel branches. 

With customer satisfaction ratings dropping below the company’s 4.5 standard, data was used to identify delays in room service, pinpoint the worst-performing locations, and uncover potential causes behind reduced service quality. 

The insights aim to support targeted improvements and restore LuxurStay’s reputation for exceptional customer service.
